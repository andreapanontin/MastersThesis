# Crystalline comparison theorem for p-divisible groups
This is the git repository for my Master's thesis.
I studied for it in Bordeaux, between January and June 2021, under the supervision of
Professor Olivier Brinon.
Its aim is to prove a crystalline comparison theorem for p-divisible groups, for a prime number p.

More specifically, let K be a complete discrete valuation field of characteristic 0 with perfect
residue field of characteristic p. I have studied Messing’s crystalline Dieudonné
theory and deformation theory of p-divisible groups, in order to prove the classification of
p-divisible groups over the ring of integers of K with Breuil-Kisin modules. 
Using crystalline techniques, this allows to relate the p-adic Tate module of a p-divisible group and
its Breuil-Kisin module by a period isomorphism, which in this case is nothing but the
crystalline comparison isomorphism between the dual of the étale cohomology and that
of the crystalline cohomology of the special fiber.
